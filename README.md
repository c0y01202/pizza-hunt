# pizza-hunt

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of Pizza Hunt was to build a database using Mongoose which is a NoSQL platform. MongoDB was installed and the model to create a pizza on the application was then built. A "pizza" controller was created and then the pizza API routes were tested with Insomnia. A "comments" section was then added, controllers were added and the routes were tested. A "replies" section was then added, controllers and routes were added and finally tested with Insomnia. The application was saved to IndexDB as a fallback option in situations with no Internet. A function was then created to handle collecting of all the data from the new_pizza object store in IndexedDB and POST functions for the server. Five issues were created and solved for this project. In the end, a pizza validation section was added to the pizza model.
